# TheGameProject

- Based on a game I have played with friends, this is a fun app written in Java, using Android Studio as an IDE.  

The group is split into two teams and players are asked to think of and input a number of names, 
usually four or five per person.  

- When ready, team one start the round and a timer begins.  
- Names are presented randomly, one by one, and it is the player holding the device that describes the person they see.  
- If the group guess correctly, the name is removed from the list, another name is presented and a score added for that team.   Play continues until the timer runs out and the device is passed to team two.  The process is continued until all the names are used and the scorecard can then be reviewed to check who was the winner.  
- Further development of the game is required as it should be three rounds, with the same names being used for each.
